## üìù About
**Kefilm** is a movie app to learn and practice Modern Android development tools. Movie data provided by [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.
+ Android 6.0+ (>23)

## üåü Todos
#### üö© Critical
+ Write a custom view library to show movie rate with percentage.
+ Add TMDb logo to images.

#### üíé Would Nice
+ Light/dark theme support üåó.
+ Offline support ‚ö´.
+ Try to achieve 60 FPS for UpcomingFragment (Maybe research on Glide caching might work?).
+ Try to achieve at least 30+ FPS for TopRatedFragment (Maybe need to remove upper items as user scroll downs? Needs better paging).
+ Work on swipe between upcoming and topRated fragments(Upcoming has horizontal RecyclerView so it might be tricky).
+ Hide the top status bar of device (Which means, run app in fullscreen).
+ Add a transition when movie details comes up (Probably based on poster image).
